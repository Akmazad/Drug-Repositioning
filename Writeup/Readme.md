# <em>In silico</em> drug repositioning
Traditional drug discovery and development are often time-consuming and high risk [[```1```](https://github.com/Akmazad/Drug-Repositioning/blob/master/Writeup/Literatures/2019%20%5BBioinformatics%5D%20deepDR%20a%20network-based%20deep%20learning%20approach%20to%20in%20silico%20drug%20repositioning.pdf)]. Repurposing/repositioning of approved drugs offers a relatively low-cost and high-efficiency approach toward rapid development of efficacious treatments.
